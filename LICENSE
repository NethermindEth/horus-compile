(however, by default it is not) to link against some GPLed libraries, and
therefore the use of these builds may be restricted in non-GPL-compatible
projects.  See below for a discussion of CLN and GLPK (the two GPLed optional
library dependences for cvc5), and how to ensure you have a build that doesn't
link against GPLed libraries.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Third-Party Software
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The cvc5 source code includes third-party software which has its own copyright
and licensing terms, as described below.

The following file contains third-party software.

  cmake/CodeCoverage.cmake

The copyright and licensing information of this file is in its header.

cvc5 incorporates MiniSat code (see src/prop/minisat and src/prop/bvminisat),
excluded from the above copyright.  See src/prop/minisat/LICENSE and
src/prop/bvminisat/LICENSE for copyright and licensing information.

cvc5 incorporates code from ANTLR3 (http://www.antlr3.org/), the files
src/parser/bounded_token_buffer.h, src/parser/bounded_token_buffer.cpp, and
src/parser/antlr_input_imports.cpp are excluded from the above copyright.
See licenses/antlr3-LICENSE for copyright and licensing information.

cvc5 by default links against The GNU Multiple Precision (GMP) Arithmetic
Library, which is licensed under GNU LGPL v3. See the file
licenses/lgpl-3.0.txt for a copy of that license.  Note that according to the
terms of the LGPL, both cvc5's source, and the combined work (cvc5 linked with
GMP) may (and do) remain under the more permissive modified BSD license.

The implementation of the floating point solver in cvc5 depends on symfpu
(https://github.com/martin-cs/symfpu) written by Martin Brain.
See https://raw.githubusercontent.com/martin-cs/symfpu/cvc5/LICENSE for
copyright and licensing information.

cvc5 optionally links against the following libraries:

  ABC                (https://bitbucket.org/alanmi/abc)
  CaDiCaL            (https://github.com/arminbiere/cadical)
  CryptoMiniSat      (https://github.com/msoos/cryptominisat)
  LibPoly            (https://github.com/SRI-CSL/libpoly)
  libedit            (https://thrysoee.dk/editline)

Linking cvc5 against these libraries does not affect the license terms of the
cvc5 code.  See the respective projects for copyright and licensing
information.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 OPTIONAL GPLv3 libraries
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Please be advised that the following libraries are covered under the GPLv3
license.  If you choose to link cvc5 against one of these libraries, the
resulting combined work is also covered under the GPLv3. If you want to make
sure you build a version of cvc5 that uses no GPLed libraries, configure cvc5
with the "--no-gpl" option before building (which is the default).  cvc5 can
then be used in contexts where you want to use cvc5 under the terms of the
(modified) BSD license.  See licenses/gpl-3.0.txt for more information.

cvc5 can be optionally configured to link against CLN, the Class Library for
Numbers, available here:

  http://www.ginac.de/CLN/

cvc5 can be optionally configured to link against glpk-cut-log, a modified
version of GLPK, the GNU Linear Programming Kit, available here:
