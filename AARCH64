How to install `horus-compile` on AArch64 macs
==============================================
In theory, this can also be done via poetry/venv. I apologize for the tool
fragmentation caused by introducing yet another way to do things via miniconda
here.

# Ensure you have `wget`.
brew install wget

# Install Miniconda: https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html
# Follow command-line prompts (may need to open a new shell).
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-arm64.sh
bash Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-arm64.sh

# Create a virtual environment running python==3.9 and activate it.
conda create -n horus python=3.9
conda activate horus

# You should see `(horus)` next to your terminal prompt.

# Install poetry.
pip install poetry

# Clone this repository and install.
git clone git@github.com:NethermindEth/horus-compile.git
cd horus-compile
CFLAGS=-I`brew --prefix gmp`/include LDFLAGS=-L`brew --prefix gmp`/lib pip install .

# Check that the executable was installed.
horus-compile --help
